# Buffet (**bu·fè**)

### Fresh ingredients, simple web dev

Buffet is a template for 2025. Let's face the truth:
- Bun is awesome and powerful
- Effect is a new way of thinking about type and exception safety
- TailwindCSS makes styling easier for both humans and AI

So why not use them together?


## Other stuff

For HTML composition, a JSX runtime from [`@kitajs/html`](https://github.com/kitajs/html) is used, to write componentized UI without React.

Right now, interactivity is achieved using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). Partials are returned directly from server's routes.

**Contributions are welcome** to help make the client-side part more robust and truly usable!
