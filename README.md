# Buffet (**bu·fè**)

### Fresh ingredients, simple web dev

Buffet is a template for 2025. Let's face the truth:
- Bun is awesome and powerful
- Effect is a new way of thinking about type and exception safety
- TailwindCSS makes styling easier for both humans and AI

So why not use them together?


## Other stuff

The stack has shifted to a more opinionated setup (previously based on HTMX and `@kitajs/html` JSX runtime):
- [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) gives Bun extra powers.
- [Eden Treaty](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview.html) keeps RPC calls end-to-end type safe.
- The client is all-in on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with modern runes and `@tanstack/svelte-query` for data.

**Contributions are welcome** to keep polishing the experience!
